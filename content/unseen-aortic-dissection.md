# Hindsight: The Unseen Aortic Dissection

Root cause analysis of diagnostic errors is crucial for improving patient safety. This case involves a 45-year-old male presenting with chest pain, whose initial chest CT was interpreted as negative for acute aortic pathology.

## Initial Presentation

The patient's initial complaint was atypical, described as a sharp, intermittent pain radiating to the back. The clinical team was primarily concerned about pulmonary embolism given the patient's recent long-distance travel.

### Clinical Context

- **Age**: 45 years old
- **Symptoms**: Chest pain, back pain
- **Risk factors**: Hypertension, smoking history
- **Clinical suspicion**: Pulmonary embolism

## The Miss

A subtle intimal flap in the ascending aorta was missed on the initial review. The radiologist's attention was focused on evaluating the pulmonary arteries for embolism, a classic example of "search satisficing" where the search is terminated after finding the first abnormality (or lack thereof).

### Contributing Factors

1. **Anchoring bias**: Initial clinical suspicion directed attention to PE
2. **Search satisficing**: Stopped searching after ruling out PE
3. **Satisfaction of search**: Failed to systematically evaluate all structures
4. **Time pressure**: Busy emergency department environment

## The Revelation

The dissection was identified on a follow-up study performed 6 hours later when the patient's pain worsened and became more typical for aortic pathology.

### Key Imaging Findings (Retrospective)

- **Intimal flap**: Subtle linear hypodensity in ascending aorta
- **False lumen**: Minimally dilated at time of initial scan
- **Pericardial effusion**: Small amount, easily overlooked

## Cognitive Biases at Play

### Anchoring Bias

The initial clinical impression of PE created a mental framework that influenced the radiological interpretation. Once this anchor was set, it became difficult to consider alternative diagnoses.

### Premature Closure

After ruling out PE, the search for other pathology was curtailed. This is a common error pattern in emergency medicine.

### Availability Heuristic

Recent cases of PE in similar patients may have increased the perceived likelihood of this diagnosis.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Systematic search patterns**: Always evaluate all structures, not just the area of clinical concern
2. **Cognitive debiasing**: Be aware of anchoring and actively consider alternatives
3. **Time management**: Balance efficiency with thoroughness
4. **Quality assurance**: Regular case review helps identify patterns of error

## System-Level Changes

Following this case, our department implemented:

- **Structured reporting templates** for chest CT
- **Cognitive bias training** for residents and fellows
- **Quality improvement initiatives** focusing on missed diagnoses
- **Double-reading protocols** for high-risk cases

## Conclusion

Diagnostic errors are multifactorial, often resulting from the interaction of cognitive biases, system pressures, and clinical complexity. Understanding these factors is the first step toward preventing future errors and improving patient safety.

This case serves as a reminder that even subtle findings can have significant clinical implications, and that systematic approaches to image interpretation are essential for minimizing diagnostic errors.
