# Case Study: Acute Appendicitis

## Clinical Presentation

A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of periumbilical pain that has migrated to the right lower quadrant. He reports nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever.

### Vital Signs

- Temperature: 100.8°F (38.2°C)
- Heart rate: 95 bpm
- Blood pressure: 125/78 mmHg
- White blood cell count: 14,500/μL

## Imaging Findings

CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast demonstrates:

### Primary Findings

- **Appendiceal wall thickening**: Measuring 8mm (normal <3mm)
- **Periappendiceal fat stranding**: Moderate inflammatory changes
- **Appendicolith**: 5mm calcified deposit within the appendiceal lumen
- **Fluid collection**: Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis

### Additional Observations

- No evidence of perforation or abscess formation
- Normal appearance of adjacent bowel loops
- No alternative explanation for symptoms

## Differential Diagnosis

While the imaging findings are classic for acute appendicitis, other conditions to consider include:

1. **Crohn's disease**: Terminal ileitis
2. **Infectious colitis**: Right-sided involvement
3. **Ovarian pathology**: In female patients
4. **Urinary tract infection**: Particularly in elderly patients

## Management

The patient was taken to surgery for laparoscopic appendectomy. Pathology confirmed acute appendicitis with transmural inflammation.

## Key Learning Points

- Appendicoliths are present in approximately 25% of cases
- Wall thickening >3mm is a reliable sign of appendicitis
- Periappendiceal fat stranding indicates inflammatory response
- CT has a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 99% for appendicitis

## Conclusion

This case demonstrates the classic CT findings of acute appendicitis. Early recognition and appropriate surgical management lead to excellent outcomes with minimal complications.
